          Paul-Michel Foucault (UK: /ˈfuːkoʊ/ FOO-koh, US: /fuːˈkoʊ/ foo-KOH,[5]
          French: [pɔl miʃɛl fuko]; 15 October 1926 – 25 June 1984), generally
          known as Michel Foucault, was a French philosopher, historian of
          ideas, social theorist, and literary critic. <br />Foucault's theories
          primarily address the relationship between power and knowledge, and
          how they are used as a form of social control through societal
          institutions. Though often cited as a post-structuralist and
          postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels.[6] <br />His thought
          has influenced academics, especially those working in communication
          studies, anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, literary theory,
          feminism, and critical theory. Activist groups have also found his
          theories compelling.[citation needed] <br />Born in Poitiers, France,
          into an upper-middle-class family, Foucault was educated at the Lycée
          Henri-IV, at the École Normale Supérieure, where he developed an
          interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors Jean
          Hyppolite and Louis Althusser, and at the University of Paris
          (Sorbonne), where he earned degrees in philosophy and psychology.
          After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to
          France and published his first major book, The History of Madness
          (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the University
          of Clermont-Ferrand, he produced The Birth of the Clinic (1963) and
          The Order of Things (1966), publications which displayed his
          increasing involvement with structuralism, from which he later
          distanced himself. <br />These first three histories exemplified a
          historiographical technique Foucault was developing called
          "archaeology". From 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the University
          of Tunis before returning to France, where he became head of the
          philosophy department at the new experimental university of Paris
          VIII. Foucault subsequently published The Archaeology of Knowledge
          (1969). <br />In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the Collège de France,
          a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a
          number of left-wing groups involved in campaigns against racism and
          human rights abuses and for penal reform. <br />Foucault later
          published Discipline and Punish (1975) and The History of Sexuality
          (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods
          which emphasized the role that power plays in society. Foucault died
          in Paris of HIV/AIDS; he became the first public figure in France to
          die from the disease. His partner Daniel Defert founded the AIDES
          charity in his memory.
